# Implementation Plan: In-Memory Todo Console Application

**Branch**: `001-todo-console-app` | **Date**: 2025-12-27 | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-todo-console-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a command-line Todo application that stores tasks in memory, demonstrating spec-driven development using the Agentic Dev Stack workflow without manual coding. The application will support the 5 core features: Add, View, Update, Delete, and Mark Complete tasks. All data will be stored in memory only with no persistence to files or databases.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard library only (no external dependencies beyond Python 3.13+)
**Storage**: In-memory Python data structures (no database, no file persistence)
**Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) - CLI application
**Project Type**: Single project - console application
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response times for all operations
**Constraints**: <100MB memory usage, offline-capable, no external APIs
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user, single-session application

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [X] Spec-First, Agentic Development Only: Following spec → plan → tasks → Claude Code implementation workflow
- [X] Workflow Mandatory: Following Spec → Plan → Tasks → Claude Code Implementation
- [X] No Manual Coding: All code will be generated by Claude Code
- [X] Correctness, Simplicity, and Clarity Over Complexity: Designing simple, clear solution
- [X] In-Memory Only: No files, DBs, or persistence - all data in memory only
- [X] Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE): Tests will be written before implementation code

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure selected with clear separation of concerns:
- models/: Data entities and their definitions
- services/: Business logic and operations
- cli/: Command-line interface and user interaction
- lib/: Supporting utilities like storage
- tests/: Unit, integration, and contract tests

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
