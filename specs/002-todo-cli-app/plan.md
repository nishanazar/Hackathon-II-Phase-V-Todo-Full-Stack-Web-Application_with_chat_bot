# Implementation Plan: In-Memory Todo CLI App

**Branch**: `002-todo-cli-app` | **Date**: 2025-01-04 | **Spec**: specs/002-todo-cli-app/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-todo-cli-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The In-Memory Todo CLI App is a command-line application that allows users to manage todo tasks in memory. The application provides a menu-driven interface for adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and marking tasks as complete/incomplete. All data is stored in memory only, with no persistence to files or databases. The application is built with Python 3.13+ and follows a clean, modular architecture separating CLI interface from business logic.

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1. **Spec-First Development**: ✅ COMPLIANT - Following spec-first methodology as required
2. **Agentic Development**: ✅ COMPLIANT - Using Claude Code for all implementation
3. **No Manual Coding**: ✅ COMPLIANT - All code will be generated by Claude Code
4. **Correctness, Simplicity, Clarity**: ✅ COMPLIANT - Design will prioritize simplicity
5. **In-Memory Only**: ✅ COMPLIANT - No file system or database persistence
6. **Test-First**: ✅ COMPLIANT - TDD will be used with tests written first

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure selected as appropriate for a CLI application. The architecture separates concerns with models containing data structures, services containing business logic, CLI containing user interface logic, and lib containing utility functions like storage abstraction. Tests are organized by type (unit, integration, contract) to ensure comprehensive coverage.
