# Claude Code Usage Instructions

This document provides instructions for using Claude Code with the In-Memory Todo Console Application project.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates spec-driven development using the Agentic Dev Stack workflow. All code was generated by Claude Code without manual coding.

## Workflow

The project follows the spec-first methodology:
1. Specification → Plan → Tasks → Claude Code Implementation
2. Each phase builds on the previous one
3. All implementation is done via Claude Code prompts

## Claude Code Prompting Rules

### General Guidelines
- Always refer to the existing codebase when making changes
- Follow the established patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistency with the existing architecture
- Write clean, readable Python code following PEP 8 standards

### Implementation Guidelines
- Generate code that matches the architecture described in plan.md
- Follow the data models defined in data-model.md
- Implement functionality according to the contracts in contracts/
- Write tests before implementation code (TDD approach)
- Ensure all functionality matches the requirements in spec.md

### Quality Standards
- Write clear, well-documented code
- Include appropriate error handling
- Follow the separation of concerns (models, services, CLI)
- Maintain the in-memory only constraint (no persistence)
- Ensure all 5 core features work correctly

## Expected Deliverables

When implementing new features or making changes, ensure:
- All 5 basic features (Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete) remain functional
- Application runs successfully from the command line
- Task lifecycle behaves correctly with unique IDs
- Codebase follows clean structure and readability standards
- Entire workflow history (spec → plan → tasks → implementation) remains traceable
- No manual code edits are introduced
