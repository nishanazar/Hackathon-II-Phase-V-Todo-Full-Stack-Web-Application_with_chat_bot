# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] Agentic Dev Stack: Write spec → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code
- [ ] Cloud-Native First: Design for scalability, loose coupling, observability, and portability
- [ ] Event-Driven Architecture: Use Kafka/Redpanda for all async communication
- [ ] Dapr Everywhere: All inter-service communication, state, pub/sub, secrets, and scheduling via Dapr sidecars
- [ ] AI-Assisted Ops: Use kubectl-ai, Kagent, and Claude Code for Kubernetes, Helm, and infra tasks
- [ ] Zero to Minimal Cost: Prefer Oracle Always Free OKE, Redpanda Cloud free tier, Azure/GCP free credits
- [ ] Demo-Ready: Final output must be a live cloud URL + GitHub repo with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Judges Focus: Show advanced features, event-driven design, Dapr abstraction, AI-assisted deployment, and monitoring
- [ ] Tech stack compliance: Next.js 16+ App Router • FastAPI • SQLModel • Neon PostgreSQL • Better Auth + JWT
- [ ] Monorepo structure compliance: .spec-kit/, specs/, frontend/, backend/
- [ ] All API endpoints follow /api/{user_id}/tasks/* pattern with JWT validation
- [ ] Dapr integration for all service communication, state management, pub/sub, and secrets
- [ ] Kafka/Redpanda for all event streaming and async communication
- [ ] Containerized deployment with Docker and orchestrated via Kubernetes
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions
- [ ] Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana or cloud-native solutions

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
