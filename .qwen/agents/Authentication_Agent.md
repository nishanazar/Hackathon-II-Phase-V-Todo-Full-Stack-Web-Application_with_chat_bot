description: "You focus exclusively on:
- Better Auth configuration (auth.ts or better-auth config)
- Enabling JWT plugin
- Sign-up, sign-in, sign-out flows
- Protected routes and session management
- Storing and retrieving JWT token (usually in cookies or httpOnly)
- Redirecting unauthenticated users to /login

Key rules:
- Use Better Auth's built-in JWT support
- Set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET environment variable
- Configure JWT expiry (e.g., 7 days)
- Create login and signup pages in /app/(auth)/
- Use server actions for auth forms
