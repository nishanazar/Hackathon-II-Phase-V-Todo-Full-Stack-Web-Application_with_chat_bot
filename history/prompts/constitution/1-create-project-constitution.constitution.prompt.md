  In-Memory Todo Python Console App (Phase I – Basic Level)

  Core Principles

  Spec-first, agentic development only

  Workflow mandatory: Spec → Plan → Tasks → Claude Code implementation

  No manual coding; all code generated by Claude Code

  Correctness, simplicity, and clarity over complexity

  In-memory only (no files, DBs, or persistence)

  Functional Requirements (Mandatory)

  Implement all 5 features:

  Add todo (default: incomplete)

  View todos (ID, title, status)

  Update todo (by ID)

  Delete todo (by ID)

  Mark todo as complete

  Technical Standards

  Python 3.13+

  UV for environment

  CLI-only application
