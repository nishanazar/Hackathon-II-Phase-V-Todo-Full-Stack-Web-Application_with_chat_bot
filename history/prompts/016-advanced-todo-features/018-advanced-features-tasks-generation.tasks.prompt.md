# Advanced Features Tasks Generation

## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

Generated comprehensive tasks.md file for the Advanced Features Implementation for Phase V Todo AI Chatbot. The tasks are organized into 7 phases:

1. Setup - Initialize project structure and configure shared infrastructure
2. Foundational - Implement core components that are prerequisites for user stories
3. User Story 1 - Enhanced Task Management (P1 priority)
4. User Story 2 - Recurring Task Automation (P2 priority)
5. User Story 3 - Automated Reminders (P3 priority)
6. User Story 4 - Advanced Task Filtering and Sorting (P4 priority)
7. Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns - Integration, optimization, and quality assurance

The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Dependencies between user stories are clearly defined, and parallel execution opportunities are identified. Each phase includes independent test criteria to ensure the implementation can be verified at each stage.

## Outcome

Successfully created tasks.md with 68 specific, actionable tasks organized by user story priority and dependencies. The tasks are ready for implementation by AI agents.
